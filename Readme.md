### OOPS Concept 
* PHP introduced object-oriented programming features since version 5.0. Object-Oriented programming is one of the most popular programming paradigms based on the concept of objects and classes.

* PHP OOP allows you to structure a complex application into a simpler and more maintainable structure.

## Chapter 1  :- Objects in PHP
* If you look at the world around you, youâ€™ll find many examples of tangible objects: lamps, phones, computers, and cars. Also, you can find intangible objects such as bank accounts and transactions.

* All of these objects share the two common key characteristics:

1) State
2)  Behavior
* For example, a bank account has the state that consists of:

1) Account number
2) Balance
* A bank account also has the following behaviors:

1) Deposit
2) Withdraw
* PHP objects are conceptually similar to real-world objects because they consist of state and behavior.

* An object holds its state in variables that are often referred to as properties. An object also exposes its behavior via functions which are known as methods.

## Chapter 2  :- Classes in PHP
* In the real world, you can find many same kinds of objects. For example, a bank has many bank accounts. All of them have account numbers and balances.

* These bank accounts are created from the same blueprint. In object-oriented terms, we say that an individual bank account is an instance of a Bank Account class.

* By definition, a class is the blueprint of objects. For example, from the Bank Account class, you can create many bank account objects.


## Chapter 3  :- Inheritance in PHP
* Inheritance allows a class to reuse the code from another class without duplicating it.

* In inheritance, you have a parent class with properties and methods, and a child class can use the code from the parent class.

* Inheritance allows you to write the code in the parent class and use it in both parent and child classes.

* The parent class is also called a base class or super class. And the child class is also known as a derived class or a subclass.

* To define a class inherits from another class, you use the extends keyword.
