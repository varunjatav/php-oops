### OOPS Concept 

## Chapter 1  :- Classes in PHP
* PHP introduced object-oriented programming features since version 5.0. Object-Oriented programming is one of the most popular programming paradigms based on the concept of objects and classes.

* PHP OOP allows you to structure a complex application into a simpler and more maintainable structure.


## Chapter 2  :- Inheritance in PHP
* Inheritance allows a class to reuse the code from another class without duplicating it.

* In inheritance, you have a parent class with properties and methods, and a child class can use the code from the parent class.

* Inheritance allows you to write the code in the parent class and use it in both parent and child classes.

* The parent class is also called a base class or super class. And the child class is also known as a derived class or a subclass.

* To define a class inherits from another class, you use the extends keyword.
